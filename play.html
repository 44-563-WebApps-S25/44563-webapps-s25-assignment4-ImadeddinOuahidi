    <h2>Hamlet</h2>

    <h3>Act 3, Scene 4. The Queen's closet.</h3>

    <p>Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and LORD POLONIUS</p>

    <h5>LORD POLONIUS</h5>
    <p>He will come straight. Look you lay home to him: Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that
        your grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here. Pray you, be round with
        him.</p>

    <h5>HAMLET</h5>
    <p>[Within] Mother, mother, mother!</p>

    <h5>QUEEN GERTRUDE</h5>
    <p>I'll warrant you, Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.</p>

    <p>POLONIUS hides behind the arras.</p>

    <p>Enter HAMLET</p>

    <h5>HAMLET</h5>
    <p>Now, mother, what's the matter?</p>

    <h5>QUEEN GERTRUDE</h5>
    <p>Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.</p>

    <h5>HAMLET</h5>
    <p>Mother, you have my father much offended.</p>

    <h5>QUEEN GERTRUDE</h5>
    <p>Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</p>

    <h5>HAMLET</h5>
    <p>Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.</p>

    <h5>QUEEN GERTRUDE</h5>
    <p>Why, how now, Hamlet!</p>

    <h5>HAMLET</h5>
    <p>What's the matter now?</p>
