    <h2>Hamlet</h2>
    <h3>Act 3, Scene 4. The Queen's closet.</h3>
    <p>
        Enter QUEEN MARGARET and POLONIUS
        LORD POLONIUS
        He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
        Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
        And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
        Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
        Pray you, be round with him.
        HAMLET
        [Within] Mother, mother, mother!
        QUEEN GERTRUDE
        I'll warrant you,
        Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
        POLONIUS hides behind the arras

        Enter HAMLET

        HAMLET
        Now, mother, what's the matter?
        QUEEN GERTRUDE
        Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
        HAMLET
        Mother, you have my father much offended.
        QUEEN GERTRUDE
        Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
        HAMLET
        Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
        QUEEN GERTRUDE
        Why, how now, Hamlet!
        HAMLET
        What's the matter now?
