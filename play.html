    <h5 class="name lord-polonious">LORD POLONIUS</h5>
    <p class="speech lord-polonious">He will come straight. Look you lay home to him: Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that
        your grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here. Pray you, be round with
        him.</p>

    <h5 class="name queen-gertrude">QUEEN GERTRUDE</h5>
